# Integrating Multi-Omic Network Data With Summay-Level GWAS Data (PanViz)
This package integrates data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) with summary-level genome-wide association (GWAS) data, such as that provided by the GWAS Catalog or GWAS Central databases, or a user's own study or dataset, in order to produce biological networks, termed IMONs (Integrated Multi-Omic Networks). IMONs can be used to analyse trait-specific polymorphic data within the context of biochemical and metabolic reaction networks, providing greater biological interpretability for GWAS data.

R package developed by [Luca Anholt](https://github.com/LucaAnholt/PanViz) and available via BioConductor (see below).
